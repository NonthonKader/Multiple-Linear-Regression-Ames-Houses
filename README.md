# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Ames-Houses
Using multiple linear regression techniques to predict house prices.

Written by Kader SORO as part of my machine learning course at EDHEC Business School.
This exercise serves as an application of various linear regression techniques presented in class.

I used the famous Ames Housing dataset from Kaggle.

**Dataset Presentation**
The Ames Housing dataset, sourced from Ames, Iowa, is frequently used in data science and machine learning, particularly for regression analysis. Created by Dean De Cock for educational purposes, it contains detailed information on 2,930 residential properties sold between 2006 and 2010.
With its diverse range of categorical and numerical variables, the dataset is ideal for applying different regression models and exploring feature engineering techniques.

The code and explanations are provided in Jupyter Notebook format.
